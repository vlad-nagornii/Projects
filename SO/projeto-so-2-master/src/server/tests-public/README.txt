# Public Tests

Place this directory in the root of your project.

To run the tests for exercise 1, run the following command:

bash ./tests-public/run_ex1.sh <executable>

Where `<executable>` is the name of the executable you want to test.

For exercise 2, run the following command:

bash ./tests-public/run_ex2.sh <executable>

The script will run with max_backups = 2

Where `<executable>` is the name of the executable you want to test.

To verify everything run the tests with valgrind.
